##  Programming Assignment 2 by Erich F Gruhn

##Example: Caching the Mean of a Vectorless 
##In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign a 
##value to an object in an environment that is different from the current 
##environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
##that stores a numeric vector and cache's its mean.

##The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a 
##list containing a function to

## 1.)  set the value of the vector
## 2.)  get the value of the vector
## 3.)  set the value of the mean
## 4.)  get the value of the mean

makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}

##The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created 
##with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has 
##already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the
##computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value 
##of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
        m <- x$getmean()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- mean(data, ...)
        x$setmean(m)
        m
}

##Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrixless 
##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
##to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there 
##are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your 
##assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

##Write the following functions:
        
## 1.)  makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that  
##      can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
		inverseMatrix <- NULL
        setMatrix <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inverseMatrix <<- NULL
        }
        
        getMatrix <- function() x 
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inverseMatrix <<- inverse 
        getInverse <- function() inverseMatrix
        list(setMatrix = setMatrix, 
             getMatrix = getMatrix,
             setInverse = setInverse, 
             getInverse = getInverse)
}


## 2.)  cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
##      returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been 
##      calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
##      retrieve the inverse from the cache.

##Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function 
##in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns 
##its inverse.

##For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inverseMatrix <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(inverseMatrix)) { 
                message("getting cached inverse matrix") 
                return(inverseMatrix) 
        }
        MatrixData <- x$getMatrix() 
        inverseMatrix <- solve(MatrixData, ...) 
        x$setInverse(inverseMatrix) 
        return(inverseMatrix) 
}
